[Master ISI Program - Algerian Ministry of Higher Education](https://cs.univ-batna2.dz/sites/default/files/web/files/master_isi_final_mesrs_apres_recours.pdf)

### Grading Formula

The calculation uses weighted averages based on module coefficients:

```
Final Average = Î£ (Module Grade Ã— Coefficient) / Total Coefficients
```

### Module Components

Each module grade is calculated based on its components:

- **Modules with Exam + TD + TP**  
  `(Exam Ã— 0.6) + (TD Ã— 0.2) + (TP Ã— 0.2)`
  
- **Modules with Exam + TD**  
  `(Exam Ã— 0.6) + (TD Ã— 0.4)`
  
- **Modules with Exam + TP**  
  `(Exam Ã— 0.6) + (TP Ã— 0.4)`
  
- **Modules with only Exam**  
  `Exam Ã— 1.0`


## Technical Implementation

The calculator is implemented as a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- Meta tags and title -->
    <style>
        /* All CSS styles */

</head>
<body>
    <!-- UI structure -->

2. **Dynamic Module Loading** - Modules load based on semester selection
3. **Grade Validation** - Ensures all inputs are between 0-20
4. **Weighted Calculation** - Computes final average based on coefficients
5. **Visual Feedback** - Color-coded pass/fail indicators
